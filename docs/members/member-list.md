## Member List

Your 'Member List' is a record of all the members in your workspace. Here you can add members, delete members, and update any permissions or features each member has access to.

### Member Creation

To add a new member to the workspace, first click on the blue <Tag colour="#1582d8" borderColour="#1582d8" fontColour="#FFFFFF">+ Member</Tag> button outlined below.



<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-create.png" alt="Member Create"/>



Then, a small menu will appear like the one below.



<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-create-menu.png" alt="Member Create Menu" width="450"/>



- **Email**: the email address of the new member.
- **Role**: the role of the new member inside the workspace. New members can either be an 'Agent', 'Administrator', or 'Owner'. Agents can have their permissions modified.Administrators have all permissions.  Owners are the same as Administrators except their role cannot be changed and they cannot be removed.

Finally, to confirm and create the new member into the workspace, click <Tag colour="#1582d8" borderColour="#1582d8" fontColour="#FFFFFF">Create</Tag>.

### Member Management

All of your workspace's members will appear here:

<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-overview.png" alt="Member Overview"/>

This menu also details some information about each member:

- **Role**: the role of the member in the workspace.
- **Email**: the registered email address of the member.

#### Update Member

When you update a member, you can change their role, status, and virtual number assignment for Email2SMS. You **cannot** change their registered email. After clicking on the button to update a member, a small menu will appear like the one below:



<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-update.png" alt="Member Update Menu" width="450"/>



You can change each option below by selecting a new option in the drop-down menus above.

- **Role**: the role of the member in the workspace.
- **Status**: whether the member's profile is enabled within the workspace. A disabled member's profile is not functional. This status can either be 'Enabled' or 'Disable'.
- **Virtual Number Assignment**: this is the [Virtual Number](../channels/virtual-numbers.md) that this member will use for [Email2SMS](#email2sms) communications. To disable Email2SMS functionality for the member, just select 'Disabled' for this option.

Finally, to confirm and register the changes, click <Tag colour="#1582d8" borderColour="#1582d8" fontColour="#FFFFFF">Apply</Tag>.

#### Permissions

Your workspace has hundreds of available functions. Administrators and Owners will always be able to access all functions. However, you can modify which functions Agents are allowed to use. These are the Agent's 'Permissions'. After clicking on the button to update permissions, a small menu will appear like the one below:



<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-permissions.png" alt="Member Permissions Menu" width="450"/>



Each permission is described by its title. For example, the 'Initiate SMS Chats' permission allows a member to start a new chat with a customer via SMS. Permissions under 'Permissions' are active for the member. Permissions under 'Unassigned' are inactive for the member. To switch permissions between categories, click on them. For example, to add a permission to 'Permissions', click on it in 'Unassigned'. To remove a permission from 'Permissions', click on it in 'Permissions'. You can also search permissions by their name by using the 'Filter' text box.

---

#### Actions

There are three actions you can perform on the 'Member List'. To access these, click on the <Tag colour="#FFFFFF" borderColour="#1582d8" fontColour="#1582d8">Actions Ë…</Tag> button outlined below.



<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-actions.png" alt="Member Actions"/>




This will give you three options:



<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-actions-extended.png" alt="Member Actions Options" width="450"/>



##### Export List to CSV

This will transfer all of the information listed here about each member into a CSV document. This CSV document will then be downloaded onto your device. When you click this option, a small menu will appear like the one below. Select the timezone you want the CSV file to use for dates and times, and then click <Tag colour="#1582d8" borderColour="#1582d8" fontColour="#FFFFFF">Get Report</Tag> to download the file.



<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-timezone.png" alt="CSV File Timezone Selection" width="450"/>



##### Bulk Upload New Members

You can add several members to the workspace at once. When you click this option, a small menu will appear like the one below. Click on 'Upload Member List' and select your CSV file with all the members you would like to add to the workspace. This document must be [formatted correctly](#formatting-member-list-file) and will be explained shortly. Alternatively, click 'Download Template (Bulk Upload)' for an example of correct formatting.



<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-upload-list.png" alt="Upload New Members" width="450"/>



###### Formatting Member List File

To be accurately read by the program, your member list must be formatted exactly as below. Replace the information in each column with the information of the new members you wish to add. You can also add more members to the file by adding a new row of information.


<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-list-format.png" alt="Member List Formatting"/>



[comment]: <> (check if this format needs to be exact)

Each column specifies a different property of each new member:

- **email**: the email address of the new member.
- **role**: the role of the new member.
- **name**: the display name of the new member within the workspace.
- **phone**: the phone number of the new member.
- **title**: the display title of the new member within the workspace.

###### Bulk Upload Configurations

Once you have uploaded your member list file and it is appropriately formatted, there are some final options you have to specify before completing the bulk upload. After uploading the file, the following options will appear:

<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-list-config.png" alt="Member List Configuration" width="450"/>


Enabling each option executes the bulk upload differently:

- **Create New Accounts**: if an email is not registered with a member (the member does not currently exist), a new member account will be created.
- **Set Member Profiles**: if an email is not registered with a member, it will be skipped in the bulk upload.
- **Both Enabled**: if an email is registered with a member (the member already exists), their current member account will be overwritten/updated with the new information.



Next, you need to tell the program how to read your file. You need to outline where certain data is located. Depending on what settings you enabled in the previous step, different settings and configurations will appear here. Below is a screenshot of all possible settings and configurations for the bulk upload. The previously screenshotted CSV file will be referenced as an example for this explanation.

<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-list-config.png" alt="Member List Configuration" width="450"/>

Each setting needs different information about your file:

- **Select first row containing Member data**: the first row in your file where you find information about a member. The example CSV file has column titles in row 1. Row 2 is the first row to contain information about a member. Thus, '2' would be appropriate here.
- **Email**: the title of the column in your file that contains the members' email addresses. The example CSV file stored member emails under the column titled 'email'. Thus, 'email' would be an appropriate option in this drop-down.
- **Role**: the title of the column in your file that contains the members' roles. The example CSV file stored member roles under the column titled 'role'. Thus, 'role' would be an appropriate option in this drop-down.
- **Name**: the title of the column in your file that contains the members' names. The example CSV file stored member names under the column titled 'name'. Thus, 'name' would be an appropriate option in this drop-down.
- **Phone**: the title of the column in your file that contains the members' phone numbers. The example CSV file stored member phone numbers under the column titled 'phone'. Thus, 'phone' would be an appropriate option in this drop-down.
- **Title**: the title of the column in your file that contains the members' titles. The example CSV file stored member titles under the column titled 'title'. Thus, 'title' would be an appropriate option in this drop-down.

Finally, to upload all the new members to your workspace, click <Tag colour="#1582d8" borderColour="#1582d8" fontColour="#FFFFFF">Confirm Details</Tag>.


##### Bulk Apply Permissions

You can modify the permissions of multiple members in the workspace at once. When you click on this option, a small menu will appear like the one below.

<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-bulk-permission.png" alt="Bulk Permission Modification" width="600"/>

To modify the permissions of several members at once:

1. Select how you want to modify the permissions with the 'Action Type'. 'Add' will add the selected permissions. 'Set' will remove any permissions that are not selected, and add any permissions that are selected.'Remove' will remove the selected permissions. 
2. Select the members you want to modify the permission of. Click on a member underneath 'Members' to select them. This will make the name appear blue. Click on the member again to unselect them.
3. Select the permissions you want to add/set/remove. 'Permissions' are the permissions selected for modification (add/set/remove). The rest of the permissions appear under 'Unassigned'. Click on a permission in 'Unassigned' to add it to the 'Permissions'. Click on a permission in 'Permissions' to unselect it and remove it from 'Permissions'.
4. <Tag colour="#1582d8" borderColour="#1582d8" fontColour="#FFFFFF">Apply</Tag>

<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-bulk-permission-steps.png" alt="Bulk Permission Modification Annotation" width="600"/>

:::tip TIP
If you are struggling to find a member or permission here, you can search them by name using the 'Filter' text box above each section.

#### Email2SMS

Email2SMS allows members to send an SMS via an email. 

##### Setup

An extended menu will appear for configuring Email2SMS:

<CustomisableImage src="/img/member-list-emailsms.png" alt="Email2SMS Configuration" width="500"/>

To configure Email2SMS for a member:

1. Select the virtual number within <BrandName type="name"/> that will be used to send your SMS. This is the 'Virtual Number Assignment'.

2. Select whether the content of your SMS will be generated from the emailâ€™s Subject or Body. This is the 'SMS Content from'. By default, it is the subject. 

3. Select the maximum SMS unit count that will be translated into SMS from the email. This allows you to cap the length of your messages. This is the 'Max SMS Units'. By default, this is 10. For an explanation of SMS Units, navigate [here](../message-types/sms.md#sms-units).

Click <Tag colour="#1582d8" borderColour="#1582d8" fontColour="#FFFFFF">Apply</Tag>. This Member is now configured for Email2SMS.


##### Using Email2SMS

Each member has a registered email. If a member is registered for Email2SMS, they can send an SMS using this email address by following three steps.:

1. Address an email to the Australian mobile number you want to send the SMS to. Use this format: &#123;&#123;number&#125;&#125;@<BrandName type="email2sms"/>.
For example 0412345678@<BrandName type="email2sms"/>

2. Enter the desired message to be sent into the email's subject or body depending on how you configured it.

3. Send the email. The SMS will be sent via <BrandName type="name"/> through the Virtual Number you have set-up with the Member.
