# Virtual Numbers

The Sender ID is the sender of a phone message. For example, when you get called, the Sender ID is what is calling you. The Sender ID is essentially the 'from' of a phone message. In the context of Yabbr, the Sender IDs are what you use to send outbound messages. You must register a Sender ID with Yabbr to then use it to send outbound phone messages elsewhere in your workspace. A Sender ID can come in three forms in Yabbbr: Virtual Numbers, [Alpha Codes, or personal 'BYO' numbers](./sender-ids.md). This documentation is about Virtual Numbers.

Alpha Codes and personal 'BYO' numbers are explained in the [Sender IDs](./sender-ids.md) documentation.

A Virtual Number is a phone number that you can rent from Yabbr for use in your workspace. Messages sent using Virtual Numbers can be responded to, and these responses can be recorded and accessed by Yabbr. Thus, Virtual Numbers are the only Sender IDs that can have inbound functionality in your workspace. Therefore, they are the only phone numbers you can use in Yabbr Chat.
